[![ESP12e build](https://travis-ci.org/muwerk/munet.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/muwerk/munet)
[![Dev Docs](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-dev-blue.svg)](https://muwerk.github.io/munet/docs/index.html)

The munet libraries use the [muwerk scheduler](https://github.com/muwerk/muwerk) to provide a
comprehensive set of network functionality: WiFi connection, Access Point Mode, NTP time sync,
OTA software update and MQTT communication for ESP8266 and ESP32 chips with a minimum of code:

```c++
#define __ESP__   // Platform define, add #define __ESP32__ for ESP32 (see dependencies)
#include "scheduler.h"
#include "net.h"
#include "mqtt.h"
#include "ota.h"

ustd::Scheduler sched;
ustd::Net net(LED_BUILTIN);
ustd::Mqtt mqtt;
ustd::Ota ota;

void appLoop();

void setup() {
    net.begin(&sched);  // connect to WiFi and sync NTP time, credentials read from ESP file system, (s.b.)
    mqtt.begin(&sched); // connect to MQTT server
    ota.begin(&sched);  // enable OTA updates

    int tID = sched.add(appLoop, "main");  // create task for your app code
}

void appLoop() {
    // your code goes here.
}

// Never add code to this loop, use appLoop() instead.
void loop() {
    sched.loop();
}

```

The library provides:

- WiFi station, acces point or both using configuration data from LittleFS/SPIFFS file system (s.b.).
  Connection to the WiFi network is established automatically. The library handles reconnect and error
  recovery gracefully.
- Over-the-air (OTA) update is supported with one line of code [optional]
- Time synchronization with NTP servers, including daylight saving handling [optional]
- Connection to an MQTT server (via PubSubClient) [optional] This transparently connects the pub/sub
  inter-task communication that is provided by the muwerk scheduler with extern MQTT publishers and
  subscribers. Messages between muwerk tasks are published to the external MQTT server, and muwerk
  tasks can transparently subscribe to both other tasks on the same ESP and external topics via the
  MQTT interface.

Dependencies
------------

munet relies only on:

- [ustd](https://github.com/muwerk/ustd). Check documentation for required
  [platform defines](https://github.com/muwerk/ustd/blob/master/README.md).
- [muwerk](https://github.com/muwerk/ustd)
- [PubSubClient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient)
- [Arduino_JSON](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_JSON).
  **Note**: Earlier versions used a different lib: ArduinoJson.

| munet component | depends on ustd | muwerk | Arduino_JSON | PubSubClient |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Net.h           | x               | x      | x            |              |
| Ota.h           | x               | x      | x            |              |
| Mqtt.h          | x               | x      | x            | x            |

Configuration
-------------

The network configuration is stored in a `json` formatted file `net.json` in the LittleFS/SPIFFS
file system of the ESP chip. Create a copy in your local file system of your project at
`data/net.json`.

'''Note:''' This project is currently preparing to move from SPIFFS (deprecated) to LittleFS. To
continue to use SPIFFS, define `__USE_OLD_FS__`. In order to activate LittleFS, your `platformio.ini`
currently needs to contain:

```
board_build.filesystem = littlefs
```

SPIFFS and LittleFS are not compatible, if the library is updated, a new file system needs to be
created and upload with `pio run -t buildfs` and `pio run -t uploadfs`.

Since ESP32 currently does not (yet) support LittleFS, ESP32 projects require the define
`__USE_OLD_FS__` to continue to use SPIFFS for the time being.

### Sample `net.json`

```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "mode": "station",
    "station": {
        "SSID": "my-network-SSID",
        "password": "myS3cr3t",
        "hostname": "myhost",
        "address": "",
        "netmask": "",
        "gateway": "",
        "maxRetries": 40,
        "connectTimeout": 15,
        "rebootonFailure": true
    },
    "ap": {
        "SSID": "muwerk-${macls}",
        "password": "",
        "hostname": "muwerk-${macls}",
        "address": "",
        "netmask": "",
        "gateway": "",
        "channel": 1,
        "hidden": false
    },
    "services": {
        "dns": {
            "host": []
        },
        "ntp": {
            "host": [
                "time.nist.gov",
                "ptbtime1.ptb.de",
                "ptbtime2.ptb.de",
                "ptbtime3.ptb.de"
            ],
            "dstrules": "CET-1CEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3"
        }
    }
}
```

Using platformio, `data/net.json` is saved to the ESP chip using:

```bash
pio run -t buildfs
pio run -t updatefs
```

Message Interface
-----------------

### Incoming

| topic            Â     | Description
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `net/network/get`     | Returns a network information object in json format in a message with topic `net/network`
| `net/network/control` | Starts, stops or restarts the network (put `start`, `stop` or `restart` in the message body)
| `net/networks/get`    | Requests a WiFi network scan. The list is returned in a message with topic `net/networks`. The additional options `sync` and/or `hidden` can be sent in the body.


### Outgoing

| topic        | message body   | comment                                |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `mqtt/config` | `<prefix>+<will_topic>+<will_message>` | The message contains three parts separated bei `+`: prefix, the last-will-topic and last-will message. `prefix` is the mqtt topic-prefix automatically prefixed to outgoing messages, composed of `omu` (set with mqtt) and `hostname`, e.g. `omu/myhost`. `prefix` can be useful for mupplets to know the actual topic names that get published externally. |
| `mqtt/state` | `connected` or `disconnected` | muwerk processes that subscribe to `mqtt/state` are that way informed, if mqtt external connection is available. The `mqtt/state` topic with message `disconnected` is also the default configuration for mqtt's last will topic and message. |

#### Messages received by mqtt:

| topic        | message body   | comment                                |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `mqtt/outgoingblock/set` | `topic[-wildcard]` | A topic or a topic wildcard for topics that should not be forwarded to the external mqtt server (e.g. to prevent message spam or routing problems) |
| `mqtt/outgoingblock/remove` | `topic[-wildcard]` | Remove a block on a given outgoing topic wildcard. |
| `mqtt/incomingblock/set` | `topic[-wildcard]` | A topic or a topic wildcard for topics that should not be forwarded from the external mqtt server to muwerk. |
| `mqtt/incomingblock/remove` | `topic[-wildcard]` | Remove a block on a given incoming topic wildcard. |

## History

- 0.2.1 (2021-01-02): Small breaking change: the format of the `mqtt/state` has been simplified: the message contains either `connected` or `disconnected`. Configuration information has been moved into a separate message `mqtt/config`. Support for no outgoing domain prefix (no 'omu') fixed.
- 0.2.0 (2020-12-25): Initial support for LittleFS on ESP8266.
- 0.1.99 2020-09 (not yet released): Ongoing preparations for switch to LittleFS, since SPIFFS is deprecated.
- 0.1.11 (2019-12-27): New mqtt.h api functions `addSubscription()`, `removeSubscription()` that
  allow to import additional topics from external MQTT server. See [API doc](https://muwerk.github.io/munet/docs/classustd_1_1Mqtt.html) for details.
- 0.1.10 (2019-11-17): Add information about external prefix to `mqtt/state` messages. (HA registration of mupplets requirement)
- 0.1.9 (2019-11-17): Allow publishing to unmodified topics using `!` topic-prefix. Send internal messages with topic `mqtt/state`
- 0.1.8 (2019-11-03): NTP Init was unreliable, fixed.
- 0.1.7 (2019-11-03): ESP32 crashes, if configTime() [for NTP setup] is called while WLAN is not connected. Fixes #2.
- 0.1.6 (2019-08-06): Outgoing messages (from ESP to MQTT server) are now prefixed by an additional outDomainToken in order
  to prevent recursions. Older versions did only prefix with ESP's hostname, but at the same time the ESP MQTT client also subscribes
  to topics starting with it's hostname. This design error caused duplicated messages.
- 0.1.5 (2019-07-24): This version uses [Arduino_JSON](https://github.com/arduino-libraries/Arduino_JSON) for JSON parsing. Older versions relied on outdated versions of the older library `ArduinoJson` which is no longer supported with `muwerk`.

## Errata
- MQTT doesn't seem to run stable with latest `PubSubClient` v2.8. It is recommended to use `PubSubClient@2.7` for the time being. This seems to affect
  both ESP8266 and ESP32

## ESP32 notes

- In order to build MQTT for ESP32, PubSubClient v2.7 or newer is needed.
- SPIFFS filesystem: Optionally use this [Arduino plugin](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin) to upload the SPIFFS filesystem to ESP32.
